I learned a lot about smacss and how quick it is to fall behind thanks to one image carousel.  i'm having trouble making it
but erik and ron helped me a lot with it.  eventually i'll get it down.  so far i have the button populating
and the images are hidden.  I still need get them to show and to also catch up with the rest of the readings/portfolios
