<h1>Week 3 of 301</h1>
<h2> Day 3 </h3>
<p> well this week was going somewhat good, felt like I was able to kick back and relax for a little bit.  It felt
nice to coast through the weeks as far as disregarding the portfolio assignment.  That was only because I thought
we were able to get a 70 in the class and be on with our life, I WAS WRONG.  Turns out its a 90 that I gotta have and a 70 on the 
entrance test.  So now I'm trying my best to get this dam image carousel uploaded but I'm hitting every bump in the road that
exists.  It's like an earthquake of idioms.  Anyways...that's what I get for trying to slack on a skill that is meant
to get me into that millionare status that I so desire.  Gotta pull my head out of my ass and move forward.  </p>
