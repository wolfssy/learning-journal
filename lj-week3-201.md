Week 2 was stressful enough to get me a week's worth of reading behind.  After catching up on the reading I've been able to see the new code a little clearer. However CSS isn't fun so far, I spent more time trying to focus then I did actually finding solutions.  But like TED talk said...I don't understand it, YET.  Being able to affectively troubleshoot errors within constructor functions and catching variables being misspelled gives me a little more hope, although I know I'll be fine.  All my codes are saved on the desktop and Github incase I were to ever need them again.  I have to keep in mind to brainstorm a plan, write out an idea of what I want, and then fill in the guts.  "The golden years are ahead of you"

DAY 2
Yesterday showed me that I knew a lot but not enough.  I hit a wall when trying to write functions.  However when i went to bed i had a moment of clarity with how the bus-mall project should be done.  I need to make it somewhat similar to the salmon cookies except create an array to push the old images in and a new array to generate new images into so i can use that in a tdEl for the individual left, center, and right images.
