# Today is the second day of Code 201.

 so far the headaches of studying prior to this class have helped me a ton.

So far HTML is easier then JavaScript because I'm not drawing elipses and trying to make a triangle fit. Yet, its starting to piss me off with how much information I am absorbing that is refusing
to correlate with each other.I thought it was cool to see how a webpage is structured so I can see why it is important to keep the code clean.
I hope to understand coding as well as I understood electrical troubleshooting and repair on the CH-53E helicopter.

I also found out that using Windows for this course is a pain in the ass. Other than that I like that the instructor actually cares about our success
and I'm pretty sure he plays League of Legends since he named his cat "Alistair".
