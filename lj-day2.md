//////Today is the second day of Code 201.

 so far the headaches of studying prior to this class have helped me a ton.

So far HTML is easier then JavaScript because I'm not drawing elipses and trying to make a triangle fit. Yet, its starting to piss me off with how much information I am absorbing that is refusing
to correlate with each other.I thought it was cool to see how a webpage is structured so I can see why it is important to keep the code clean.
I hope to understand coding as well as I understood electrical troubleshooting and repair on the CH-53E helicopter.

I also found out that using Windows for this course is a pain in the ass. Other than that I like that the instructor actually cares about our success
and I'm pretty sure he plays League of Legends since he named his cat "Alistair".


///////////////////// DAY 5 
wooo Its friday on the first week! so far ive felt a rollercoaster of emotions. I originally thought I bit off more than I could
chew but after the 2nd lab I felt better.  Going home accomplished of that number 6 question was a feeling of accomplishment
I haven't felt in years.  It was like fixing the aircraft and watching it fly off thanks to me. I didn't expect to
find out that paired coding was way more fun.  I mean ya its wonderful to bust my ass and see my achievements, but its
another to see what 2 minds can do in a smaller amount of time.  At the beginning of this week I was forcing myself to
open the laptop at home after a long commute, but yesterday I found myself willingly sitting down and cracking open the
books.  I can't wait until next month when I visit my homies in San Diego and make them think im all over the yahoo news
for "being able to drink longer then Mike" (a buddy of mine).  
What I really can't wait for is applying all this new stuff to a job and paying off all my families' bills so we can finally
bounce back from the recession all those years ago.
