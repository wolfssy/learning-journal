mid week 4 PROJECT WEEK:
Lola, Phil, Adam and I have been tasked with creating a game as our final.  We sat down on friday and went over 2 ideas but decided we liked Lola's idea of FuzzFeed.  I was honestly intimidated at first because my team has a ton of knowledge, but soon I realized that my troubleshooting skills and quick thinking made me a good navigator.  I ended up with the task of finding the Images for the cards and creating the fun questions.  Which has been cool but I found out how quick merge conflicts can happen if I do the wrong thing.  I accidently mixed up a few questions and images which was fun to deal with.  I feel like I haven't made enough contributions to the team but that's why we're a team, we're supposed to split up the work according to the most affective method possible.  Adam and I worked heavily on the start up page and did a great job, Lola and Phil were able to do their own pages and we all ended up working together perfectly.
