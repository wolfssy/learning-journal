mid week 4 PROJECT WEEK:
Lola, Phil, Adam and I have been tasked with creating a game as our final.  We sat down on friday and went over 2 ideas but decided we liked Lola's idea of FuzzFeed.  I was honestly intimidated at first because my team has a ton of knowledge, but soon I realized that my troubleshooting skills and quick thinking made me a good navigator.  I ended up with the task of finding the Images for the cards and creating the fun questions.  Which has been cool but I found out how quick merge conflicts can happen if I do the wrong thing.  I accidently mixed up a few questions and images which was fun to deal with.  I feel like I haven't made enough contributions to the team but that's why we're a team, we're supposed to split up the work according to the most affective method possible.  Adam and I worked heavily on the start up page and did a great job, Lola and Phil were able to do their own pages and we all ended up working together perfectly.

its friday finally, this week wasn't as hard as the previous weeks luckily.  Our team has a presentation today that I can't wait to get over.  I'm in dire need of at least a couple days of my summer back.  plus it would be nice to not have to wake up at 5:00 again.  Anyways, i learned a ton about local storage and how to use functions to work CSS into the mix.  it makes things run a hell of a lot smoother.
