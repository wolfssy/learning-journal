<h2>End of week 2.</h2>
This week is exactly the same compared to week 2 of 201 with the exception that I dont have a huge headache all the time. 
Heavily thinking about my future whether I want to push through this place and jump into 401 or come back home for the winter
to attend community college.  So far it seems I'm leaning towards pushing through 401 JS because I remembered how important 
this skill will become.  I see the TA's and think to myself "alright, if they made it, so can you".  The same shit I would 
tell myself in USMC bootcamp.  I'm looking forward to the next two weeks and even moreso with the following 2 months.  The sooner
I graduate this place, the faster I can pay off my parent's bills.
