<h2> week 3 day 2 </h2>
</p>Yesterday was interesting.  found out my sister will be moving up here.  I'm pretty excited about that, helps me relax after
realizing that not all people are friendly and willing to help.  It's not going to stop me from helping others if I got
the knowledge, but I'll be careful from here on out with who I decide to help.  or rather how much I let the person figure out 
the answers on their own.  I'm barely keeping up, I would most likely have an F in the course right now if it wasn't for the 
pair programming.  screw it. </p>
