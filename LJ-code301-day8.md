This past week has been the easiest hard week ever.  I'm doing good on my lab assignments so far but I just can't get the motivation 
to do my dam homework at home.  Tonight I'm going to knock out as many of the reading assignments as I can before the weekend.
This weekend and next I hope to finish the portfolio and run it in finally so I can stop feeling bad for myself.
As far as going to 401, I'm stuck between mobile apps and JS 401 so that'll be interesting to figure out for my future.
